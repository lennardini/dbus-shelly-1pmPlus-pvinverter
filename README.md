# dbus-shelly-1pmPlus-pvinverter
This Fork is for Shelly 1PM / Plus and also for 3Phase inverters who can be mesured with 1 Shelly 1 PM / Plus.
The Plus Shellys are Shelly gen 2 and they are different to the old round formed Shelly 1 PM.
Both types are supported, and it can be set in the config file.
Integrate Shelly 1PM (PLUS) into Victron Energies Venus OS
Logfile ist not set in the config by default because of potetial issues with file size in case of long time disconnects.
To enalbe logging just name a log file in the config.ini


## Purpose
With the scripts in this repo it should be easy possible to install, uninstall, restart a service that connects the Shelly 1PM to the VenusOS and GX devices from Victron.
Idea is inspired on @fabian-lauer project linked below.
Forked from viktr0rm and changed to the new Shelly 1PM Plus



## Inspiration
This project is my first on GitHub and with the Victron Venus OS, so I took some ideas and approaches from the following projects - many thanks for sharing the knowledge:
- https://github.com/fabian-lauer/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter
- https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/gen1/#shelly1-shelly1pm
- https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/dbus#pv-inverters

## How it works
### My setup
- Shelly 1PM Plus with latest firmware (20220209-094317/v1.11.8-g8c7bb8d)
  - Measuring AC output of NAME_YOUR_INVERTER on phase L3 
  - Connected to Wifi netowrk "A" with a known IP  
- Venus OS on Raspberry PI 4 4GB version 1.1 - Firmware v3.13
  - Connected to Wifi netowrk "A"

### Details / Process
As mentioned above the script is inspired by @fabian-lauer dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter implementation.
So what is the script doing:
- Running as a service
- connecting to DBus of the Venus OS `com.victronenergy.pvinverter.http_{DeviceInstanceID_from_config}`
- After successful DBus connection Shelly 1PM is accessed via REST-API - simply the /status is called and a JSON is returned with all details
  A sample JSON file from Shelly 1PM can be found [here](docs/shelly1pm-status-sample.json)
- Serial/MAC is taken from the response as device serial
- Paths are added to the DBus with default value 0 - including some settings like name, etc
- After that a "loop" is started which pulls Shelly 1PM data every 750ms from the REST-API and updates the values in the DBus

Thats it üòÑ

## Install & Configuration
### Get the code
Just grap a copy of the main branche and copy them to a folder under `/data/` e.g. `/data/dbus-shelly-1pm-plus-pvinverter-1`.
After that call the install.sh script.

The following script should do everything for you:

FOR SHELLY 1:
```
wget https://github.com/lennardini/dbus-shelly-1pmPlus-pvinverter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip "dbus-shelly-1pmPlus-pvinverter-main/*" -d /data
mv /data/dbus-shelly-1pmPlus-pvinverter-main /data/dbus-shelly-1pm-plus-pvinverter-1
chmod a+x /data/dbus-shelly-1pm-plus-pvinverter-1/install.sh
/data/dbus-shelly-1pm-plus-pvinverter-1/install.sh
rm main.zip
```
FOR SHELLY 2:
```
wget https://github.com/lennardini/dbus-shelly-1pmPlus-pvinverter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip "dbus-shelly-1pmPlus-pvinverter-main/*" -d /data
mv /data/dbus-shelly-1pmPlus-pvinverter-main /data/dbus-shelly-1pm-plus-pvinverter-2
chmod a+x /data/dbus-shelly-1pm-plus-pvinverter-2/install.sh
/data/dbus-shelly-1pm-plus-pvinverter-2/install.sh
rm main.zip
```
FOR SHELLY 3:
```
wget https://github.com/lennardini/dbus-shelly-1pmPlus-pvinverter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip "dbus-shelly-1pmPlus-pvinverter-main/*" -d /data
mv /data/dbus-shelly-1pmPlus-pvinverter-main /data/dbus-shelly-1pm-plus-pvinverter-3
chmod a+x /data/dbus-shelly-1pm-plus-pvinverter-3/install.sh
/data/dbus-shelly-1pm-plus-pvinverter-3/install.sh
rm main.zip
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Check configuration after that - because service is already installed an running and with wrong connection data (host, username, pwd) you will spam the log-file

### Change config.ini
Within the project there is a file `/data/dbus-shelly-1pm-plus-pvinverter-1/config.ini` - just change the values - most important is the deviceinstance, custom name and phase under "DEFAULT" and host, username and password in section "ONPREMISE". More details below:

| Section  | Config vlaue | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| DEFAULT  | AccessType | Fixed value 'OnPremise' |
| DEFAULT  | SignOfLifeLog  | Time in minutes how often a status is added to the log-file `current.log` with log-level INFO |
| DEFAULT  | Deviceinstance | Unique ID identifying the shelly 1pm in Venus OS |
| DEFAULT  | CustomName | Name shown in Remote Console (e.g. name of pv inverter) |
| DEFAULT  | Phase | Valid values L1, L2 or L3: represents the phase where pv inverter is feeding in |
| ONPREMISE  | Host | IP or hostname of on-premise Shelly 3EM web-interface |
| ONPREMISE  | Username | Username for htaccess login - leave blank if no username/password required |
| ONPREMISE  | Password | Password for htaccess login - leave blank if no username/password required |
